# Steps to Run the App: 
You can simply build and run the code in Xcode 

# Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I chose to prioritze they layout of the desserts.  The API calls for the endpoints were pretty straight forward using async await, so I spent some time making the list look more aesthetically pleasing.

# Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
A little over 3 hours I would say.  The bulk of my time was getting the network calls to work properly as well as arranging the UI.

# Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I don't believe so.  The images are all being cached and there is not really any major functionality except for sorting the cuisines.

# Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
Well, if I had a million cuisines to sort through, I'm not sure how the performance would hold up.

# External Code and Dependencies: Did you use any external code, libraries, or dependencies?
There was no need to.

# Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
The only thing I could think of would be if I were to recieve an excessive amount of data.
